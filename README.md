Experienced in building web, mobile and desktop applications from scratch, with 3+ years of leadership managing frontend teams and mentoring junior developers. Strong expertise in frontend and mobile development, combined with end-to-end backend proficiency to deliver scalable, high-performance solutions.

I' ve been working on [KuultoAI](https://www.kuulto.app) | Don't forget to try Kuulto CLI with AI, Liike (screen recording and video editor app with magic zoom), Liike (free mockup generator) and KuultoOS (kind of browser with multiworkspaces)

Keenly interested in AI/ML innovations, I stay updated with the latest advancements. I develop AI projects—including CLI tools, web, and mobile applications—using Python, Go, Swift, and Kotlin to automate tasks and boost productivity in my personal work.
